# Abstract:

In this paper we are following standard CRISP-DM development methodology to build the predictive model for the first period grades of Student Performance Data Set on the UCI machine learning repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance).
This is clearly the classification problem and we approach the problem by performing multiple regression on the dataset which will be first pre-processed to get the best outcome
Keywords: classification, multiple regression, pre-processed


## Wrote a Paper and performed the Data Mining on the Student Performance Data Set[Paper](https://github.com/hiteshsantwani/Predictive-Model-for-Student-Performance-Data-Set/blob/master/Final%20Draft.pdf)

# Conclusion

•    Achieveing  good first grade is important as it will also become the motivation for good performance in the future
•    Target for higher education 
•    Have a well balance between Extra cirricular activities and paid classes
•    Always ensure the good Study time and most importantly choose the school with good reviews
•    Being punctual helps a lot in Achieveing good grades.
•    Travel less
